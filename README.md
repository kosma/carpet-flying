# Flying Carpet

Nonsensical set of Carpet rules and additions. Do not expect rhyme nor reason here.
Watch out for possible loss of marbles. Do not ask too many question. Have a nap.

I accept suggestions for features of this mod. The weirder, the better.

(equivalent of breaking and replacing the workstation).
